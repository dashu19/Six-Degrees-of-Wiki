# Six-Degees-of-Wiki

This is a pet project to see if I can learn how to interact with Wikipedia's API to see if I can traverse through a page's internal links to find another page within 6 degrees.

Going to start building the functionality with python, and see if I can turn it into an interactive website of sorts.
